# FAB
Data Processing and Visualization for Forest and Biodiversity Experiments

<br />

### Details
This package provides a set of tools to process and visualize inventories

on key calculations such as mortality or Net Biodiversity Effects.

This is a supporting package of the manuscript by Cavender-Bares et al. (2024) *Forest and Biodiversity 2: a tree diversity experiment to understand the consequences of multiple dimensions of diversity and composition for long-term ecosystem function and resilience.*(Link)[https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.09.584227].
