################################################################################

#' @description It estimate the Net Biodiversity Effect (NBE) its two components: 
#' complementary effect (CE) and selection effect (SE).
#' 
#' @param experiment_design A \code{data.frame} with columns representing species 
#' and rows representing plots. Each cell most contain relative abundance of species
#' per plot. Plot IDs should be embedded as \code{rownames} otherwise row numbers 
#' will be returned as plot IDs.
#' 
#' @param measured_feature If it is a \code{data.frame} should 
#' describe measurements at the species level (e.g., biomass, growth rates), with 
#' columns as species and rows as plots similar to \code{experiment_design}. If it
#' is a numeric vector it should describe measured feature at the community level.
#'
#' @return A data.table with the estimations of Net biodiversity effect (NBE) and 
#' its two components: complementary effect (CE) and selection effect (SE) per 
#' plot.
